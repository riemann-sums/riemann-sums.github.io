# integral-visual

Visualization of different riemanns sums with a variable function and interval size.
Click anywhere in the graph to toggle the active sum (left hand, trapezoidal, and
midpoint).
Press f to enter a custom function.
Window bounds are currently fixed but support for variable scales is coming soon.

### To-do:

- [ ] refactor (separate modules for graph & sums logic)
- [ ] add padding around graph (possibly 1px white border?)
- [ ] clean up UI, possibly add buttons, mobile friendly
- [ ] only calculate area when necessary (dingus...)
